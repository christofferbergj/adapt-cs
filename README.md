# Hobby project - work in progress

This is a project I use as a technical playground üè° trying to see how valid Fullstack development feels like with a modern Next.js based stack.

Not everything will be beautifully implemented, so take everything with a pinch of salt.

‚Äì And feel free to seek inspiration from this. ü§û

## All pages and features are viewable

I've left all pages/features viewable for demo purposes.

Some actions still require **authentication** and/or **admin privileges**.

## Project description

At Adapt we play Counter Strike at an internet caf√© called "G4ME TIME Parken" once a month.

We have established a "Penalty Box" and a set of penalties e.g. arriving late or one being killed by an opponent in game with a knife etc.

All of these penalties have been logged manually by me in our Slack channel while playing, but I am now building a small web application to handle this, and provide penalty overviews for the players, so they can see what fines they've got and some statistics.

## Stack:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - The React Framework for Production
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) - Authentication for Next.js
- [Prisma.io](https://www.prisma.io/) - Next-generation Node.js and TypeScript ORM
- [Planetscale](https://planetscale.com/) - MySQL-compatible serverless database platform
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) - End-to-end typesafe APIs made easy
- [Radix colors](https://www.radix-ui.com/colors) - A gorgeous, accessible color system
- [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) - Unstyled, accessible components for building high‚Äëquality design systems and web apps in React.
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
